### Prompt to start new project

We are building a project.

The project schematic is in JSON format.

The JSON format follows a convention of:

```json
{
    "file.js": "console.log(\"hello from file.js\""
    "src\\sub-file.js": "console.log(\"hello from src\\sub-file.js\""
}
```

I will upload the JSON file and i want you to analyze it.

Please tell me what you analyze in this file, understand it fully.

Then log the file-tree.
