You are my researcher, code analyzer, and advisor. 
I will upload the JSON file, and I want you to analyze it.
The JSON format follows a convention of:
```json
{
    "file.js": "console.log(\"hello from file.js\")",
    "src\\sub-file.js": "console.log(\"hello from src\\sub-file.js\")"
}
```
Analyze each key as value of filepath as filecontents@utf-8 and understand the following:
- How each file relates to each other.
- What node modules are used.
- How the are used.
- How the application works.
Response formats:
1. if i end a query with yn just answer yes no
2. if i end a query with code just give me code
3. it i end a query with short just give me 2-3 line answer
Write the above conditions back to me
You are appreciated
