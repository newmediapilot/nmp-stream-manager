We are building a project.

The project schematic is in JSON format.

The JSON format follows a convention of:

json
Copy code
{
    "file.js": "console.log(\"hello from file.js\")",
    "src\\sub-file.js": "console.log(\"hello from src\\sub-file.js\")"
}
I will upload the JSON file, and I want you to analyze it.

Analyze each file and understand the following:

What it does.
How each file relates to each other.
How the application works.
The routes exposed by the app.
The API endpoints (src/modules).
The HTML endpoints (src/views).
All comments.
All console logs.
All function logs.
All required modules for functions.
The contents of the package.json file.
What the app is, its features, and what it does.
Then log the file tree and say "ready."

When I ask for code output, never add inline comments to explain things. Keep explanations short but warn about any gotchas, potential bugs, crashes, or things that could cause issues or are not recommended.
